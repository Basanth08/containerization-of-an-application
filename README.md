# Containerization of an Application

I created this project to explore and demonstrate the process of containerizing an application. The image above represents the theme and focus of my journey into containerization. As I progress, I'll share each step, what I learned, and how I set things up, making this a personal and engaging walkthrough.

## Scenario


When I started this project, I was dealing with a multi-tier application stack that was running on virtual machines. I found myself regularly deploying updates and handling continuous changes. This scenario set the stage for my exploration into containerization, as I wanted to simplify deployments and better manage ongoing changes.

## Problem


As I worked with this setup, I ran into several challenges. I noticed high capital and operational expenses, and human errors would sometimes creep into deployments. The architecture wasn’t compatible with microservices, which limited my flexibility. I also saw resources being wasted and struggled with portability—my environments were often out of sync. These problems pushed me to look for a more efficient and reliable approach, which led me to explore containerization.

## Solution

To address these challenges, I turned to containers. I found that containers consume fewer resources and are a perfect fit for microservice designs. By deploying via container images, I ensured that the same images could be used across all environments, making my deployments reusable and repeatable. This approach not only solved my earlier problems but also made my workflow much more efficient and reliable.

## Statistics

As I explored containerization, I came across some interesting statistics. For example, half of organizations have containerized their applications, with a significant portion running in production. Many use AWS as their platform, and most are managed by DevOps teams. Seeing these numbers gave me confidence that I was moving in the right direction and that containerization is a proven, widely adopted approach.

## Tools

For this project, I chose a set of tools that made containerization possible and efficient. I used Docker as my container runtime environment, which allowed me to package and run applications in isolated containers. My stack included NGINX for web serving, a Java-based VPROFILE application, MySQL for data storage, and RabbitMQ for messaging. Each tool played a crucial role in building a robust, scalable, and maintainable application environment.

## Steps

Here’s how I approached containerizing my application stack. First, I set up all the necessary services and found the right base images from DockerHub. I wrote Dockerfiles to customize each image and created a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate multiple containers. After everything was set up, I thoroughly tested my setup and hosted the images on DockerHub, making my stack easy to deploy and share.

## Architecture

Here’s a look at the architecture I designed for this project. This diagram shows how all the different services and components interact within the containerized environment. By visualizing the architecture, I was able to ensure that each part of the stack communicates efficiently and that the overall system is robust, scalable, and easy to manage. This step was crucial in planning and executing a successful containerization strategy.
